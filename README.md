# Speech emotion recognition via a spiking neural network

My goal in this project is to learn about how a 
[reservoir computing](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2634-4386/ac7db7)
approach can be used in signal processing. My plan is to implement a spiking 
neural network architecture inspired by 
[Dong M, Huang X, Xu B (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0204596)
with speech-to-spike encoding inspired by 
[Pan et al., (2020)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2019.01420). The SNN
will be adapted to the task of speech emotion recognition. 
I will train this model using the public dataset posted
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dmitrybabko/speech-emotion-recognition-en).
